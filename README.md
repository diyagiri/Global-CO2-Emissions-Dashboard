🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions & Climate Impact — Tableau Dashboard
📊 Overview
This Tableau project explores global CO₂ emissions trends, country-level patterns, and climate impact through interactive, multi-tab dashboards.

It answers key questions like:

How are CO₂ emissions evolving over time?

Which countries are top emitters?

How do emissions compare to population and GDP?

What are the forecasts for the coming years?
