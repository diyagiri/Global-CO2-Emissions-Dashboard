# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions & Climate Impact Dashboard

This Tableau project explores global and country-level CO₂ emissions using a clean, interactive dashboard experience. Built using data from *Our World in Data*, the dashboards highlight historical trends, top emitters, per capita emissions, and future forecasts.

## 📊 Dashboards Included

### 1️⃣ Global Overview – The Global Carbon Crisis
A high-level snapshot of the climate situation:
- 🌡️ Global KPIs: Total CO₂, temperature rise, per capita emissions
- 📈 Emission trends over time
- 🗺️ Choropleth map of CO₂ by country
- 🏭 Top 10 global emitters
- 🔘 Bubble chart: Cumulative CO₂ vs Share of Global CO₂

### 2️⃣ Country-Level CO₂ Emissions Dashboard
Zoom in to analyze any specific country:
- 📉 CO₂ over time with YoY growth (color-coded)
- 👤 CO₂ per capita (treemap)
- ⚡ Emissions by fuel type (area + pie)
- 🔮 Forecasted CO₂ emissions (5-year projection)
- 💰 CO₂ vs GDP scatter plot for economic comparison

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Global CO₂ emissions are rising**, despite climate commitments.
- **India** and **China** show sharp total increases, but remain moderate in per capita terms.
- **Coal** is the leading emission source for many countries.
- Countries like the **USA** have high cumulative emissions, but their annual share is declining.
- A strong link exists between **GDP and CO₂**, but **policy efficiency** varies across countries.
- **Forecasts** suggest emissions will rise further if no major interventions occur.

---

## 🎯 So What?

- 📌 Enables governments and climate bodies to **target high-impact sectors or fuels**.
- 🧭 Helps users explore **per capita and historical responsibility** dynamics.
- 🔍 Supports data-driven storytelling for **climate journalism or activism**.
- 🔮 Forecasting adds a predictive lens for **climate planning and policy design**.
